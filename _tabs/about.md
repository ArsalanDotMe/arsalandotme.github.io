I'm an experienced software engineer and engineering manager with nearly a decade of hands-on experience across various tech stacks. I've been part of the early-stage journey of several startups and co-founded some of my own. My approach to software development is pragmatic, prioritizing the delivery of software using battle-tested tools rather than chasing shiny new technologies. I have extensive practical experience in serverless and AWS services, and I'm passionate about improving developer productivity.

Based in beautiful Tallinn and open for remote opportunities.
